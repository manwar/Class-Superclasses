Things that can be done
=======================

 * Check if Compiler::Lexer might be a candidate to replace PPI
   * Write a benchmark that compares Compiler::Lexer with PPI
 * Check if all possible ways to create an inheritance tree are covered
 * Is test coverage ok?
 * Does the documentation cover all the stuff?
